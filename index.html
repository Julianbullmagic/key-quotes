  <h2>George Orwell/h2>
  <p>“Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it.  Many of the normal motives of civilised life — snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc. — had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master. However much one cursed at the time, one realised afterwards that one had been in contact with something strange and valuable. One had been in a community where hope was more normal than apathy or cynicism, where the word ‘comrade’ stood for comradeship and not, as in most countries, for humbug. One had breathed the air of equality.”
― George Orwell, Homage to Catalonia </p>
  <h2>Einstein</h2>
  <p>“A human is, at one and the same time, a solitary being and a social being. As a solitary being, they attempt to protect their own existence and that of those who are closest to them, to satisfy their personal desires, and to develop their innate abilities. As a social being, they seeks to gain the recognition and affection of their fellow human beings, to share in their pleasures, to comfort them in their sorrows, and to improve their conditions of life. Only the existence of these varied, frequently conflicting, strivings accounts for the special character of a human, and their specific combination determines the extent to which an individual can achieve an inner equilibrium and can contribute to the well-being of society. It is quite possible that the relative strength of these two drives is, in the main, fixed by inheritance. But the personality that finally emerges is largely formed by the environment in which a person happens to find themself during their development, by the structure of the society in which they grows up, by the tradition of that society, and by its appraisal of particular types of behavior. The abstract concept “society” means to the individual human being the sum total of their direct and indirect relations to their contemporaries and to all the people of earlier generations. The individual is able to think, feel, strive, and work by themself; but they depends so much upon society—in their physical, intellectual, and emotional existence—that it is impossible to think of them, or to understand them, outside the framework of society. It is “society” which provides people with food, clothing, a home, the tools of work, language, the forms of thought, and most of the content of thought; their life is made possible through the labor and the accomplishments of the many millions past and present who are all hidden behind the small word “society.”. Almost everything we do, every single day is heavily dependent on a staggeringly complicated network or relationships with other people, every time you use any tool or material, or knowledge from any other source than your own brain, you accumulate an enomrous debt to your species that cannot ever be repaid. Most of what you think you know you did not personally figure out from your own experience and reasoning, it came from that of other humans. People can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting themselves to society.
